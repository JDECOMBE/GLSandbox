# GLSandbox

This repository is used to try out stuff using OpenGL..

You can switch between projects in the Program.cs file. Each project is referred as a "Game".

## BatchRenderingGame

Meant to try out batch rendering with impostors in distance, and real mesh for close up details.

Not everything is optimized and code isn't clean, as I made this project in a 3-4h, this is just a PoC that I may improve in the future.
